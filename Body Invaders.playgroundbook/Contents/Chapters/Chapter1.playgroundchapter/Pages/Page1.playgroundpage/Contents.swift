 # Welcome to Body Invaders
In this playground you’ll dip your toes into the bottomless sea of view animations. Don’t be misled by the playground's title, however — getting started with such a powerful and rich API means there’s a lot of interesting material to cover!

In this playground, you’ll learn how to do the following:

* Set the stage for a cool animation.
* Create move and fade animations.
* Adjust the animation easing.
* Reverse and repeat animations.

There’s a fair bit of material to get through, but I promise it will be a lot of fun. Are you up for the challenge?

Tap **Run My Code** on the right to see the login screen of a fictional airline app. The app doesn’t do much right now; it just shows a login form with a title, two text fields, and a big friendly button at the bottom.

The project is ready for you to jump in and shake things up a bit!
